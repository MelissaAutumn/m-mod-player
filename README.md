# M Mod Player

It's a module player. Built in Svelte, and powered by [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/) via web assembly!

## Module Files
Module files are packed music file format. You can find more information about them on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file#Structure).

Playback is handled entirely by [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/) via web assembly.

Note: I use the term Sequence on the front-end to mean a Sub Song.
